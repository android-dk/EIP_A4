# EIP_A4

* Three models were implemented: ResNet56_v1 with Learning Rate adjusted in 4 steps , ResNet56_v1 with Learning Rate adjusted in 5 steps, ResNet20_v1.

* All models have a validation accuracy of greater than 88%

* Resnet56_v1 with Learning Rate adjusted in 4 steps gives the best validation accuracy and validation loss :
  
  
    * Test loss: 0.5038006238937378
    * Test accuracy: 0.8981999754905701

* Gradcam visualisations of ResNet56_v1 models were better than that of ResNet20_v1.
